# Deep Learning for Healthcare
## Project

This replication of the domain-guided recurrent neural network paper by Yin et al. (2019) is available in the "code" directory. Users may also access the Google Colab Space for the replication at https://colab.research.google.com/github/johnbiggan/DeepLearningforHealthcare-Project/blob/main/Code/Project.ipynb. The data comes from the pyhealth package as well as the knowledge graph files located in the public "data" directory. The notebook containing the code is setup to be run in sequence with no additional setup needed. If the user would like to use a different data set or a different knowledge graph with the same structure, they can modify the path to each.
